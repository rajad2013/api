Step	Impact with Sniffed Token
1. Client Hello	No Impact: The client hello does not involve sensitive data or tokens.
2. Server Hello	No Impact: The server sends its public certificate and encryption method, and no tokens are involved here.
3. Server Certificate Verification	No Impact: This step does not involve the token; the client is only validating the server's public certificate.
4. Certificate Request	No Impact: Tokens are not typically exchanged during this step; the server requests the client certificate.
5. Client Certificate and Key Exchange	No Impact: If the attacker cannot access the clientâ€™s private key, they cannot impersonate the client or decrypt traffic.
6. Client Certificate Verification	No Impact: Tokens are not part of this verification process; the server validates the client certificate.
7. Secure Connection Established	Potential Impact: If the token sniffed by the attacker is a session token or used for authentication in application-level protocols, they might reuse it to impersonate the client.


1. Client Hello	No Impact: The client hello does not involve certificates or sensitive data.
2. Server Hello	No Impact: The server sends its public certificate and encryption method, unaffected by client-side compromise.
3. Server Certificate Verification	No Impact: The client still validates the server's certificate; this step is unrelated to the client's CA or certificates.
4. Certificate Request	Impacted: The server requests the client's certificate. If the client's CA is compromised, malicious certificates could be issued and presented.
5. Client Certificate and Key Exchange	Impacted: The client sends its (possibly compromised) certificate. A malicious actor could present fake certificates, impersonating the legitimate client.
6. Client Certificate Verification	Impacted: The server verifies the client's certificate. If the client's CA is compromised, the server could mistakenly trust invalid or malicious certificates.
7. Secure Connection Established	Impacted: If the server accepts a malicious certificate, a secure connection is established with the attacker, enabling impersonation or data theft.
